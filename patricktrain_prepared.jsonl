{"text":"False statements from the Putin regime blame the victim, Ukraine, for Russia’s aggression.

{"text":"This follows a pattern of Russian behavior of undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries in the region – invading and occupying parts of Georgia in 2008, and failing to honor its 1999 commitment to withdraw its troops and munitions from Moldova, where they remain without the government’s consent.","label":"NOT_MISLEADING","metadata":null}
{"text":"Russia’s deployment of combat forces is a mere repositioning of troops on its own territory.","label":"MISINFORMED_OR_POTENTIALLY_MISLEADING","metadata":null}

In accordance with its obligations under that international agreement, the United States does not use chemical weapons. However, the Russian government has twice used chemical weapons in recent years to attack and attempt to assassinate opponents, including on foreign soil. Rather than fuel conflict in eastern Ukraine as Russia has done, the United States has provided more than $351 million in humanitarian assistance to those affected by Moscow’s aggression there since 2014. Russia is using statements from high-level officials as well as disinformation and propaganda outlets to intentionally spread outright falsehoods to attempt to create a pretext for military action.","label":"NOT_MISLEADING","metadata":null}
